<h3> Protein structure </h3>
<p>
  In order to fully comprehend the neural network in the later chapters, a bit of background information about the structure of proteins is required. 
  There are four components in these structures, in the following complexity order: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quarernary.
</p>
<p>
  The most basic structure is the primary. It is determined by the linear sequence of the components, the amino acids. 
  There are 20 neutral ones, and a few ambigous mixtures. These amino acids for a long chains by connecting to each other, resulting in the primary protein structure.
  The following image illustrates this process:

  The secondary structure refers to the local substructure of these proteins. This is also called the backbone. There are two different types of secondary structure:
  alpha-helix, and beta-sheets, as illustrated by this image:

  The three dimensional shape of a single protein chain is called the tertiary structure. This is determined by the bonds within the chain, as per the following image:

<p>
  The final, quarternary structure is determined by the aggregation of various different chains. The bond between these individual chains gives the final structure
  of the protein, as showcased by this image:
